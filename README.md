# Synergy

## Quick Start

> **Note**
> The [db](./packages/db) package is preconfigured to use PlanetScale and is **edge-bound** with the [database.js](https://github.com/planetscale/database-js) driver. If you're using something else, make the necesary modifications to the [schema](./packages/db/schema) as well as the [client](./packages/db/index.ts) and the [drizzle config](./packages/db/drizzle.config.ts). If you want to switch to non-edge database driver, remove `export const runtime = "edge";` [from all pages and api routes](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo/issues/634#issuecomment-1730240214).

To get it running, follow the steps below:

### 1. Setup dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Configure environment variables
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
cp .env.example .env

# Push the Drizzle schema to the database
pnpm db:push
```

### 2. When it's time to add a new package

To add a new package, simply run `pnpm turbo gen init` in the monorepo root. This will prompt you for a package name as well as if you want to install any dependencies to the new package (of course you can also do this yourself later).

The generator sets up the `package.json`, `tsconfig.json` and a `index.ts`, as well as configures all the necessary configurations for tooling around your package such as formatting, linting and typechecking. When the package is created, you're ready to go build out the package.
